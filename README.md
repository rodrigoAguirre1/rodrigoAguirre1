# About me:

Hello, my name is **Rodrigo Aguirre**. I'm from Argentina and I'm 25 years old.

I am an advanced student of the Sound Engineering degree and I am also starting my career as a Software Engineer.

During my years studying Sound Engineering I had subjects where I learned my first concepts related to programming, making scripts to solve problems related to sound, using Python.

Currently I am looking to improve my skills as a Software Engineer and be able to join the two branches in the future: Sound Engineering and Software Engineering.

### My journey as a Software Engineer:

I am interested in cloud infrastructure design, so in 2022 I started training. First with concepts related to networks, to later internalize myself in the services provided by AWS and finally I was certified as a Solutions Architect. In turn, to improve the workflow with these services, I learned about infrastructure as code and became a certified Terraform Associate.

In a complementary way, I learned about frontend, starting with basic languages such as html, css and javascript to finally merge them with the React library, incorporating concepts such as state, routing and hooks, thus achieving the design of interactive user interfaces.

I learned to work with GitHub and thus take advantage of Git as a version control system. I also used Docker to work with containers.

I am focused on continuing to improve my skills as a software engineer by working in a company that challenges me on a daily basis and allows me to continue growing as a professional.
